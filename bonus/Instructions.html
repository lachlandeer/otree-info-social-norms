    <h3>Bonus Task</h3>
    <p>There are 5 decision problems in this task. In each decision problem, you will see signals and the mean value from one of the decision problems in your previous task. Your goal is to guess the average number of tokens that the other two group members allocated under each piece of information.</p>
    <p>One of the decision problem will be randomly selected for calculating your bonus from this task. The closer your guess is to the average tokens allocated by your group members, the higher your bonus will be. The bonus will be calculated accordingly to the formula below:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Bonus = 1000 – (the sum of squared difference between the average allocated tokens and your guess across all four pieces of information) / 4</p>
    <p>You can expect to earn more by assigning tokens in a manner that is closer to your group members’ because the deduction is smaller the closer your guess is to the actual average allocated tokens to each piece of information.</p>
    <p>The more tokens other players assign to a piece of information, the more important they consider it is in determining the target value. The number of tokens other players assigned is between 0 and 100, and all 100 tokens are used.</p>
