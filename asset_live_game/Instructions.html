    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <p>In this task, you will engage in {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} decision-making problems in a group of three. In each decision problem, each group member will weigh up all information to guess the Target Value of a hypothetical asset:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Target Value = 50% of the Value of the Asset (V) + 50% of the Peer Price</p>
    <p>Your Target Value depends half on the value of the asset (V) and half on your “peer price.” <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: double;">The value of the asset (V) is randomly determined and may vary for each decision problem. The "peer price" is calculated as the average of your two group members' guesses of their own target values.</span></p>
    <p>You can maximize your potential payoff in each round by correctly predicting the value of the asset (V) and the peer price and valuing them equally.</p>
