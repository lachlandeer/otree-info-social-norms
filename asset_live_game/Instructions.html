    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <p>In this task, you will engage in {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} decision-making problems in a group with two other study participants. In each decision problem, each group member will weigh up all information to estimate the Target Value of a hypothetical asset:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Target Value = 50% of the Value of the Asset (V) + 50% of the Peer Estimate</p>
    <p>Your Target Value depends equally on the value of the asset (V) and on your “peer estimate.” <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">The value of the asset (V) is randomly determined and may vary for each decision problem. The "peer price" is calculated as the average of your two group members' guesses of their own target values.</span></p>
    <p>You can maximize your potential payoff in each round by correctly predicting the value of the asset (V) and the peer estimate and valuing them equally.</p>
