    <p>In this example, your three signals show 98, 103 and 99. You will be given 100 tokens to allocate toward the information.</p>
    <p>The more tokens you assign to a certain piece of information, the more important you consider it is when predicting the target value:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Target value = the Value of the Asset (V)</p>
    <p>To take a guess, you need to input your allocated tokens into their respective boxes.</p>
    <p>In this example, you have 35 tokens allocated to 98, 10 tokens to 103, 35 tokens to 99, and 20 tokens to the mean value. Your guess of the target value is calculated by adding up the weighted values of each allocation. The formula used is: (35% × 98) + (10% × 103) + (35% × 99) + (20% × 100) = 99.25.</p>
    <p>You can adjust your allocation of the tokens until you are satisfied with your guess. Once you have optimized your allocation, click the "Next" button to complete the pricing task.</p>
    <p>The closer your guess is to the Target Value, the higher your payoff from this decision problem will be. The payoff will be calculated accordingly to the formula below:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">500 – (Your Assigned Price – Target Value)<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can expect to earn more by assigning a price that is closer to the Target Value</span> because the deduction is smaller the closer your assigned price is to the Target Value (V).</p>
    <p>At the end of the study, one decision problem will be randomly selected for calculating your earnings in this study. Each decision problem is equally likely to be selected. The feedback screen will show (your allocation of tokens,) your guess of the Target Value, the value of the asset (V), the peer price and your target value in that decision problem.</p>
    <p>In this example, suppose V is 105.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your earnings are 500 – (99.25– 105)<sup>2</sup> = 466.9375 points</p>
